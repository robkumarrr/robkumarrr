# Welcome! I'm Rob. 
## 👋🏽 About Me

- 💼 I just joined **Vehikl Inc.** as a full-time software developer and I'm surrounded by excellent developers who are helping me learn.
- ⚡ I'm currently working on improving my skills in **Laravel**, **Vue**, **React** and **TDD**.
- 🎵 I just finished working on a concert tracking app for my capstone project at **Mohawk College**, and I recently created a recipe tracker for fun.
- 🌱 I always enjoy levelling up my skills and using practice-based learning to understand concepts deeply.
