### Welcome! I'm Rob. 

I'm a software development student and I enjoy discovering solutions for problems that I'm interested in. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a concert tracking app (I *love* music) and a documentation-style site for study sessions 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning JavaScript, C#, PHP, Python, SQL and various libraries and frameworks.

Thanks for checking out my profile!
