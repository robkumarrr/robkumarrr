## Welcome! I'm Rob. 

#### I'm a software development student and I enjoy discovering solutions for problems that I'm interested in. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a concert tracking app (I *love* music) for my capstone project, and I recently created a recipe tracker for fun. 
- ðŸŒ± I always enjoy learning JavaScript (React, Next.js, Express, Node), PHP (Laravel), Python, SQL and various libraries and frameworks.
- âš¡ I'd love to learn some C, C++ and more Java in my free time.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Have a wonderful day.
