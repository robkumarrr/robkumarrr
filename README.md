## Welcome! I'm Rob. 

#### I'm a software development student and I enjoy discovering solutions for problems that I'm interested in. 

- ⚡ I'm working on improving my skills in Laravel, Vue and React at the moment for work.
- 🔭 I just finished working on a concert tracking app for my capstone project at Mohawk College, and I recently created a recipe tracker for fun. 
- 🌱 I always enjoy learning levelling up my skills and using practice-based learning to understand concepts deeply.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Have a wonderful day.
